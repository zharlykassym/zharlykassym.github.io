Hi, my name is Tamerlan! I am a Software Developer with experience in mobile development and a passion for creating impactful applications. I am from the vibrant city of Almaty, Kazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿.

Along with my enthusiasm for Android development, I am deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, its integration with software, and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. I believe that innovation in these areas will transform the way we live and work.

Outside of programming, I enjoy diving into books, improving my English, and writing expressively to share ideas and experiences. I also run a Telegram channel where I post interesting language insights and learning resources.
